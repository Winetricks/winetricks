# This script should be used for bisecting wine regressions that affect winetricks
# For example, if dotnet20 works in wine-2.0, but not wine-2.2, use:
# $ cd $WINE-GIT
# $ git bisect start
# $ git bisect good wine-2.0
# $ git bisect bad wine-2.2
# Note: -q -v are automatically added
# $ git bisect run /path/to/this/script dotnet20
