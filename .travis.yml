# Note: if statements cannot go across multiple lines. Combine into one, or move to a shell script!

# Ubuntu notes:
#    * ShellCheck is already installed in TravisCI
#    * bashate is not available on Trusty and we need to install it manually
# macOS note:
#    * Homebrew doesn't provide bashate, they don't package things
#      that are on pypi
#
# We use a script that installs bashate by unpacking .deb files built for
# Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) because:
#   1. python-bashate 0.3.1-2 (for Artful) can be installed but
#      Artful will not be supported after July 2018
#   2. python-bashate 0.5.1-1 (for Bionic) can't be installed on Trusty
#      because it contains "control.tar.xz"
#      > dpkg-deb: error: archive '/var/cache/apt/archives/python-bashate_0.5.1-1_all.deb' has premature member 'control.tar.xz' before 'control.tar.gz', giving up
#      > dpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/python-bashate_0.5.1-1_all.deb (--unpack):
#      > subprocess dpkg-deb --control returned error exit status 2
#   3. Adding apt-line for newer Ubuntu release breaks dependencies
#      e.g. can't install Official Wine package on Ubuntu
#      > The following packages have unmet dependencies:
#      >  winehq-stable : Depends: wine-stable (= 3.0.0~trusty)
#      > E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
#   4. Ubuntu Bionic is an LTS release and will be supported until April 2023
#      This means that we can use version 0.5.1-1 until April 2023
#   5. The installation via the script is quick
#      (simply download and unpack files)
#
# If the script fails, install pip and use it to install bashate
before_install:
    - time sh ./misc/travis-install-bashate-deb.sh || time sh ./misc/travis-install-bashate-pip.sh
      # "brew update" (or auto-update when installing) takes long time
      # checkbashisms and shellcheck can be installed without this
      # So installing with "HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1" considerably reduces
      # job time on macOS
      # If it fails retry with auto-update
    - if [[ "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME" == "osx" ]] ; then time env HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 brew install checkbashisms shellcheck || time brew install checkbashisms shellcheck ; fi

# Note if testing on a branch, you can replace this with your desired command, e.g.,:
# script: time sh ./src/winetricks -q comctl32
# Some tests require a working $DISPLAY, and not just Xvfb. See tests/winetricks-test for the list.
# Either skip those / test manually, or run them on OS X.

# Also note:
# Installing wine on the vms is a pain.
# Linux: currently can't get 1.8.x / 1.9.x installed :/
# OS X: 38 minutes

# shell-checks is quick and works, no display or compiles needed

script: time sh ./tests/shell-checks

# OS X doesn't allow writing to /usr/bin, skip non-PREFIX make install test there
install:
    - if [[ "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME" != "osx" ]] ; then time sudo make install ; fi
    - time make install PREFIX="$(mktemp -d)"
